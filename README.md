# A Lucky Ducky Framework
A framework, based on Godot, being used to make an application that allows for easier development with the Garden Microcontroller and other Arduino microcontrollers.

## Some unique features currently are:
- Auto-linking libraries to STEMMA QT/QWIIC connections
- Hover over certain components on the 3D model of the board, like STEMMA QT/QWIIC or buttons, to see their serial output
- Certain methods can trigger visual events in the editor, such as delay() showing how long is left before continuing the program

Alongside these features are also compiling and uploading to the microcontroller, compile error highlighting, and ability to view the serial output via the serial monitor.

# Current Focus
My main focus is to finish up the remaining basic features and fix any edge cases or bugs that show up. Afterwards, I will add the Garden Microcontroller specific features, Like the ESP32 NOW visulaizer support, and add specific support for any Arduino libraries that could be used for garden/plant monitoring and automation.
